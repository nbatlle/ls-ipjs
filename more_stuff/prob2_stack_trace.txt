The above stack track indicates the following:
  The error occurred in line 4 of the program exercise2.js in the /Users/wolfly/tmp/ 
directory.
  The error occurred at "greeting" which is on column 15 of line 4.
  The JS engine doesn't know what "greeting" is because it hasn't been defined; in other
words there has been no "let greeting" statement prior to line 4 to create the variable.
